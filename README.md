# AMReX Astro Diagnostics

A collection of tools to work with plotfiles generated by AMReX-Astro codes.
The main difference here from what is in `amrex/Tools/Plotfile` is these can
use Microphysics.

## Setup

To build these tools, you need to define the environment variables:

* `AMREX_HOME` : this should point to the top-level `amrex/` directory

* `MICROPHYSICS_HOME` : this should point to the top-level
  `Microphysics/` directory
